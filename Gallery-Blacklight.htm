    </h1>

    <p>Blacklight Painting is a special effect type of
      painting used in “dark rides” to create a glow in the dark effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The painting is done in blacklight, using UV light fixtures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Kirsten has literally spent years in blacklight painting many dark
      rides for theme parks.&nbsp; </span>Incredible
      effects can be created by intermixing blacklight and whitelight paints for
      an extensive color palette.</p>
