    <p>Kirsten has worked on several attractions with
      extensive rockwork painting done in blacklight and whitelight.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The sculpture done in concrete by the extremely talented Disney
      Rockwork Sculptors is a joy to paint, so meticulously sculpted that it
      practically paints itself.</p>

Kirsten self-performed much painting in this scene, working closely with WDI Production Designer Mary Blankenberg.   Kirsten was relocated to Japan to perform her role as Installation Supervisor of Show Art Paint – park-wide.   Kirsten worked extensively on installation paint efforts for  the interior of Mermaid Lagoon.    Kirsten supervised and self-performed much rockwork painting, especially in Ursula’s (pictured)."><img
