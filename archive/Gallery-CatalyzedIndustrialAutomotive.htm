            title="In 2010, Kirsten consulted for Fountain People http://www.fountainpeople.com/  to lead the Scenic Paint Efforts for the Nemo Splash Pad for the Disney Cruise Line’s two new ships.  The first ship (and third of the fleet)  “Dream” made it’s maiden voyage in December of 2010.  Kirsten made several trips to Fountain People’s facility in Texas to paint the figures and coral.  Kirsten brought in George Gomez, Automotive finishes expert and previous WDI colleague,   http://starlitegarage.com/,  to apply the PPG high performance polyurethane clearcoat that was used on to protect these items from extreme conditions of water effects, weather and guest interaction. Kirsten also travelled to Germany to paint a 100 foot long mural directly on the ship’s walls in Interfine 679, a polysiloxane, extremely industrial catalyzed paint."><img

Kirsten has been Susan’s “right hand man” on many projects.  The Main Sphere was so large that a spray booth in which to paint it was built especially for it at a Disney vendor, remotely located in the countryside of Nara, Japan.  PPG Chrome Illusion Color Shift base coat/ clearcoat paint system was used.   With a high gloss clearcoat, the color shifting metallics are spectacular.   Additionally, Kirsten supervised minor touch ups to the Main Sphere as part of her duties as Installation for Show Art Paint park-wide for the construction of the Hong Kong Disneyland Theme Park which opened in 2005."><img
